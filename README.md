This Python code is designed to automate the process of sending personalized emails with an attachment to multiple recipients listed in an Excel file. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:
1. Imports:

    smtplib: Used for sending emails using the SMTP protocol.
    email.mime.multipart, email.mime.text, email.mime.base: These are used to create a multipart email with different parts (text body and attachment).
    encoders: Used for encoding the attachment to ensure it can be sent over email.
    os: For file path and existence checking.
    docx: A library for reading .docx Word files.
    openpyxl: A library to read and write Excel files (for email addresses and names).

2. Functions:

    read_word_file(word_file_path):
        Takes the path to a Word document (.docx) and extracts all its paragraphs as a string.
        It reads each paragraph and concatenates them to form the email body text.

    read_email_addresses_from_excel(excel_file_path):
        Loads an Excel file using openpyxl, reads the email addresses and names from columns A (email) and B (name), starting from row 2.
        Stores these as tuples (email, name) in a list and returns it.

    send_email(recipient, subject, body, attachment_path):
        Sends an email to the specified recipient.
        Sets up an email with the provided subject, body, and attachment (if the path exists).
        The email is sent using Gmail's SMTP server (smtp.gmail.com), with authentication using your email and App password.
        The email is sent with the attachment encoded in base64.

3. Workflow:

    Paths for files:
        word_file_path: Path to the Word document that contains the email body.
        attachment_path: Path to the PDF file (or any other attachment) you want to send with the email.
        excel_file_path: Path to the Excel file containing email addresses and names.

    Reading the email body:
        The content of the email is read from the Word document using read_word_file(), and stored in email_body.

    Reading email list:
        The email addresses and names are read from the Excel file using read_email_addresses_from_excel().

    Email Sending:
        For each recipient in the email list, a personalized email is sent by replacing the placeholder [Name] in the email body with the recipient’s actual name.
        The subject is hardcoded as "Job Opportunity Inquiry".

4. Execution:

    The send_email() function is called inside a loop for each recipient in the list, sending a personalized email with the attachment.

Key Steps:

    Personalized emails: The [Name] placeholder in the email body is replaced with each recipient's name to make the email personal.
    Attachment: If the provided file path for the attachment is valid, the file is sent with each email.

Important Notes:

    Sender’s credentials: The sender's Gmail credentials (email and app password) are hardcoded, which might need to be updated for security reasons.
    Excel format: It assumes the Excel file has email addresses in column A and names in column B starting from row 2.
